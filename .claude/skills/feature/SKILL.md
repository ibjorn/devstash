# Feature Workflow

Manages the full lifecycle of a feature from spec to merge.

## Working File

@context/current-feature.md

### File Structure

current-feature.md has these sections:

- `# Current Feature` - H1 heading with feature name when active
- `## Status` - Not Started | In Progress | Complete
- `## Goals` - Bullet points of what success looks like
- `## Notes` - Additional context, constraints, or details from spec
- `## History` - A one-line pointer to `context/feature-history.md`, where completed features are logged (append only, oldest first). That file is never `@`-imported, so it doesn't load into every session — refer to it by plain path.

## Task

Execute the requested action: $ARGUMENTS

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `load` | Load a feature spec or inline description |
| `start` | Begin implementation, create branch |
| `review` | Check goals met, code quality |
| `test` | Check for testable logic for server actions and utilities |
| `explain` | Document what changed and why |
| `complete` | Commit, push, merge, reset |

See [actions/](actions/) for detailed instructions.

If no action provided, explain the available options.
